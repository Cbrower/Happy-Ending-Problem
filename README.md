# Happy-Ending-Problem
Testers to assist in solving the unsolved math problem called the Happy Endings Problem:
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HappyEndProblem.html

Each file other than helper_func.py are separate testers

happyEnding.py is a demo file used to show others how the problem works.  It generates random points and attempts to find a solution, showing its attempt graphically.
happyTester.py generates a set of points n number of times.
happySolver.py takes in the number of sides and attempts to find a partial solution to the happy endings problem.

Next Step:
Accelerating code with CUDA to substantially increase execution speed.
